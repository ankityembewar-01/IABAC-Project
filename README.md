Project Summary
INX Future Inc Employee Performance - Project

The Data science project which is given here is an analysis of employee performance. The goal of the project is to find the performance rating of the employees depending on features of the data, Such as TotalWorkExperienceInYears, EmpDepartment, Gender, ExperienceYearsInCurrentRole etc.,
The Goal and Insights of the project are as follows:

Department wise performances
Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance
A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs.
This will be used to hire employees
Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis
The given Employee dataset consist of 1200 rows. The features present in the data are 28 columns. The shape of the dataset is 1200x28. The 28 features
are classified into quantitative and qualitative where 19 features are quantitative (11 columns consists numeric data & 8 columns consists ordinal data) and
8 features are qualitative. EmpNumber consist alphanumerical data (distinct values) which doesn't play a role as a relevant feature for performance rating.

From Correlation we can get the important aspects of the data, Correlation between features and Performance Rating.Correlation is a statistical measure
that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related.The analysis of the project has gone through the stage of distribution analysis,
correlation analysis and analysis by each department to satisfy the project goal.

The dataset consists of Categorical data and Numerical data. The Machine Learning model which works well for categorical data is ExtraTreeClassifier. Target variable consist of ordinal data, so this is a classification problem.The machine learning model which is used in this project is extratreeclassifierr which predicts higher accuracy 94%.

One of the important goal of this project is to find the important feature affecting the performance rating. The important features were predicted using the machine learning model feature importance technique. The main technique used in the preprocessing data using the Label Encoding method to convert the string - categorical data into numerical data, because, Most of machine learning methods are based on numerical methods where strings are not supportive. The overall project was performed and achieved the goals by using the machine learning model and visualization techniques.

1. Requirement
The data was given from the IABAC for this project where the collected source is IABACâ„¢. The data is based on INX Future Inc, (referred as INX ). It is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as top 20 best employers past 5 years. The data is not from the real organization. The whole project was done in Jupiter notebook with python platform.

2. Analysis
Data were analyzed by describing the features present in the data. the features play the bigger part in the analysis. The features tell the relation between the dependent and independent variables. Pandas also help to describe the datasets answering following questions early in our project. The data present in the dataset are divided into numerical and categorical data.

Categorical Features
These values classify the samples into sets of similar samples. Within categorical features are the values nominal, ordinal, ratio, or interval based. The categorical features as follows:

EmpNumber
Gender
EducationBackground
MaritalStatus
EmpDepartment
EmpJobRole
BusinessTravelFrequency
OverTime
Attrition
Numerical Features
These values change from sample to sample. Within numerical features the values are discrete, ordinal, continuous, or timeseries based. The Numerical Features as follows:

Age
DistanceFromHome
EmpHourlyRate
NumCompaniesWorked
EmpLastSalaryHikePercent
TotalWorkExperienceInYears
TrainingTimesLastYear
ExperienceYearsAtThisCompany
ExperienceYearsInCurrentRole
YearsSinceLastPromotion
YearsWithCurrManager
Ordinal Features
EmpEducationLevel
EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction
EmpJobInvolvement
EmpJobLevel
EmpJobSatisfaction
EmpRelationshipSatisfaction
EmpWorkLifeBalance
PerformanceRating
Alphanumeric Features
Numerical, alphanumeric data within same feature. EmpNumber is a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types. Within aphanumeric feature the values are distinct (unique).

Distribution of Numerical Features
This helps us to determine, among other early insights, how representative is the training dataset of the actual problem domain.the distribution can be derived or visualized using the density map between the numerical or categorical features present in the data.

The age distribution is starting from 18 to 60 where the most of the employees are lying between 30 to 40 age count
Employees are worked in the multiple companies up to 8 companies where most of the employees worked up to 2 companies before getting to work here.
The hourly rate range is 65 to 95 for majority employees work in this company.
In General, Most of Employees work up to 5 years in this company. Most of the employees get 11% to 15% of salary hike in this company.
Check for Normal Distribution
Checking weather the data is Normally distributed or Not with Skewness and Kurtosis, By defining a funtion
YearsSinceLastPromotion, This column is skewed
Range of skewness & kurtosis, S< |1.96|
skewness for YearsSinceLastPromotion: 1.9724620367914252
kurtosis for YearsSinceLastPromotion: 3.5193552691799805
Operation on Skewed Data for Machine Learning
Skewed data is common in data science: skew is the degree of distortion from a normal distribution.
Square Root Transformation
Square root transformation is one of the many types of standard transformations.This transformation is used for count data (data that follow a Poisson distribution) or small whole numbers. Each data point is replaced by its square root. Negative data is converted to positive by adding a constant, and then transformed.
Distribution of Categorical Features
The Gender variance is divided by 60% of Male employees and 40% of Female employees in the company.
The number of the educational backgrounds present in the employees are belongs from six unique backgrounds.
Nineteen unique employee job roles are present in this company.
The most of the employees are having the education level of Bachelor level
The Job satisfaction level in this company is high level for the majority of employees.
The 85% of employees are not having attrition in their work
only 11% of employees in the company were achieved Outstanding - performance rating
The overall percentage of employees doing overtime is 30%
Data Cleaning
The Data cleaning and wrangling is the part of the Data science project where the workflow the project go through this stage. because the damaged and missing data will lead to the disaster in the accuracy and quality of the model. If the data is already structured and cleaned, there is no need for the data cleaning. In this case, the given data is well structured and cleaned and there are no missing data present in this data.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues.

While performing data preprocessing, it is found that there are some outlier present in following feature.

NumCompaniesWorked
TotalWorkExperienceInYears
TrainingTimesLastYear
ExperienceYearsAtThisCompany
ExperienceYearsInCurrentRole
YearsWithCurrManager
Analysis by Visualization
We can able to perform the analysis by the visualisation of the data in two forms here in this project. One is by distributing the data and visualize using the density plotting. The other one is nothing but the correlation method which will visualize the correlation bar plot and we can able to achieve the correlation values between the numerical features.

1. Distribution Plot
In general, one of the first few steps in exploring the data would be to have a rough idea of how the features are distributed with one another. To do so, we shall invoke the familiar distplot function from the Seaborn plotting library. The distribution has been done by both numerical and categorical features. it will show the overall idea about the density and majority of data present in a different level.

2. Correlation
The next tool is barplot with correlation function. By plotting a correlation barplot, we have a very nice overview of how the features are related to one another. For a Pandas data frame, we can conveniently use .corr which by default provides the Pearson Correlation values of the columns pairwise in that data frame. The correlation works best for numerical data where we are going to use all the numerical features present in the data.

From the above Pearson correlation heat plot, we can see that correlation between features with numerical values in the dataset. The heat signatures show the level of correlation from 0 to 1. from this distribution we can derive the facts as follows:

The Total years of experience and job level are having the higher correlation when comparing to all features.
Experience years at this company and years with the current manager has the second higher relation between these features.
Experience years at this company and experience in the current role makes the sense of correlation.
People who have more experience with the company has the more probability to get the promotion from the correlation between them.
In this plot, the age has the important role in the total number of work experience of an employee where it is a universal truth.
Machine Learning Model
The machine learning models used in this project are

Extra Trees classifier
Random Forest classifier
Both machine learning algorithms are best for classification and labelled data. The train and test data are divided and fitted into the model and passed through the machine learning. Since we have already noted the severe imbalance in the values within the target variable, we implement the SMOTE method in the dealing with this skewed value via the learn Python package. The predicted data and test data achieved the accuracy rate of,

Extra Trees Classifier: 96.32%
Random Forest classifier: 96%
3. Summary
The machine learning model has been fitted and predicted with the accuracy score. The goal of this project is nothing but the results from the analysis and machine learning model.

Goal 1: Department wise performances
In department wise performance, we have to analyze the data from each department present in the category. The data frame has to be separated or sliced according to department wise. In Employee department feature there are six departments available. The performance analysis by the department as follows:

Sales: The excellent Performance is more in the sales department. The male performance rating little bit higher compared to female. The total work experience does not count the performance rating.

Human Resources: The majority of the employees lying under the excellent performance. The older people are performing low in this department. The female employees in HR department doing really well in their performance. The total work experience does matter to performance in this department.

Development: The largest number of employees are excellent performers. Employees of all age are belongs from excellent performance. The gender-based performance is nearly same for both.

Data Science: The highest average of excellence performance is in data science department. Data science is the only department where less number of good performers. The overall performance is higher compared to all departments. The age does not count as an important factor in their performance. Male employees are doing good in this department. Same like HR, the number of work experience does matter.

Research & Development: The age factor is not deviating from the level of performance here where different employees with different age are there in every level of performance. The R&D has the good female employees in their performance.

Finance: The finance department performance is exponentially decreasing when age increases. The male employees are doing good. The experience factor is inversely relating to the performance level.

2. Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance
The Feature Selection Technique in sklearn also contains a very convenient and most useful attribute feature importance which tells us which features in our dataset has given most importance through ML. From correlation barplot also we get important features. Both Techqiues are giving same results. The top three important features affecting the performance rating are ordered with their importance level as follows,

Employment Environment Satisfaction
Employee Salary Hike Percentage
Experience Years In CurrentRole
Goal 3: A Trained model which can predict the employee performance
The trained model is created using the machine learning algorithm as follows with the accuracy score,

Extra Trees Classifier: 96.32% accuracy
Random Forest classifier: 96% accuracy
Goal 4: Recommendations to improve the employee performance
The overall employee performance can be achieved by employee environment satisfaction. The company needs to focus more on the employee environment satisfaction.
The salary hike will give the boost to the employees to perform well financially and psychologically.
The promotion will help the employees to achieve more performance by giving the chance to be more responsible and leadership qualities.
The experience years in current role need to be revised while offering the employment to the new employees.
Employee's work-life balance affects the performance rating.
While recruiting for HR, consider the female candidates where they perform well compared to male.
The development and sales department is having an overall higher performance comparing to rest of the departments.
While some of the employees who gives feedback like Low & Medium from Job Satisfaction & Relationship Satisfaction feature, such employees gives Excellent performance more in number. So company should focus on them.
